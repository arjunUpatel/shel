# shel

## Overview
Here one more half=baked shell for the world. I hope no one actually uses this

## Features
- Executes programs.
- Supports foreground and background process execution.
- Handles kill and suspend signals via keyboard (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Z).

## Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Execute `make` in the root directory. This builds the `shell` executable.

## Usage
Run the `shell` executable. You will be greeted with a command prompt. Enter commands as with a typical shell. Functionality is limited compared to standard shell.
